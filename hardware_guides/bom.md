In the paper, we use braided 4 strand tinsel wire from [Maeden Innovation Co.](https://www.maeden.com/en/flexiblewire/tinselwire) but we suggest the enameled magnet wire as a more affordable and accessible substitute. If interested in using the Maeden tinsel wire, here is the info: Part No. CAG25D53YA, Lot No. 21081105, N.W. > 79, 5 conductor.
